#  Chatbot Interface with Gemini API

**Get ready to develop an intelligent conversational partner** powered by the Gemini API! This project focuses on training a chatbot using the TensorFlow framework and integrating it with the Gemini API for enhanced functionality.

##  Quick Start

**1. Set Up Your Environment:**

Before diving in, create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Here's a quick guide:

**Windows:**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/project`).
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

**Unix/macOS:**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Once your virtual environment is active, install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3. Set up Gemini API Key:**

Create a file named `.env` in your project directory and add the following line, replacing REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key  file:

```bash
API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

```

**4. Run Chat:**

To run chat:

```bash
python app.py
